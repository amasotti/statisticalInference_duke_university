# Statistical inference from the GSS data

This repo contains my final project for the Coursera Course "Statistical Inference with R" offered by the Duke University.
The main file, besides the raw data, is a R Markdown file.

## Data
The data used in this project come from the *General Social Survey* (henceforth *GSS*), a data diffusion project started in 1972. The database used here contains cumulative data gathered between 1972 and 2012. The total length of the database is 57061 (corresponsing to the individual subjects) for which 114 responses to as many variables are reported (including NAs and Missing data).

The data are provided with the purpose of providing scholars in different fields but also policy makers and politicians information on what North Americans think about many central social and political issues such as gender, spending priorities, intergroup relaitons and so on.

+ The General Codebook and Official documentation: [download here](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/34802/versions/V1/datadocumentation)
+ A list of the variables with a short description is available [here](https://gss.norc.org/documents/codebook/GSS_Codebook_index.pdf)

## Research questions for this project

1. Does a migratory background have an effect on the educational degree? With other words do people whose parents were born in the US have different probabilities of reaching a higher educational degree?
